/**
 * A mutable container for an immutable object tree with cross-tree {@link Reference}s,
 * providing snapshot-at-start semantics via {@link ReadSession ReadSession},
 * managing updates via {@link BoskDriver},
 * and notifying listeners of changes via {@link #hookRegistrar() hookRegistrar}.
 *
 * <p>
 * The intent is that there would be one of these injected into your
 * application using something like Guice or Spring beans,
 * managing state in a way that abstracts the differences between
 * a standalone server and a replica set.
 * Typically, you make a subclass that supplies the {@link R} parameter
 * and provides a variety of handy pre-built {@link Reference}s.
 *
 * <p>
 * Reads are performed by calling {@link Reference#value()} in the context of
 * a {@code ReadSession}, which provides an immutable snapshot of the bosk
 * state to the thread.
 * This object acts as a factory for {@link Reference} objects that
 * traverse the object trees by walking their fields (actually getter methods)
 * according to their {@link Reference#path}.
 *
 * <p>
 * Updates are performed by submitting an update via
 * {@link BoskDriver#submitReplacement(Reference, Object) submitReplacement} and similar,
 * rather than by modifying the in-memory state directly.
 * The driver will apply the changes either immediately or at a later time.
 * Regardless, updates will not be visible in any {@code ReadSession}
 * created before the update occurred.
 *

	/**
	 * Finds methods annotated with {@link Hook} in the given {@code receiver} object

	 * <p>
	 * The {@link Hook @Hook} annotation specifies the <em>scope</em> of the hook:
	 * a path string indicating which state tree node whose updates will trigger the hook.
	 * The scope path may contain parameters (e.g., {@code "/widgets/-widget-"}),
	 * in which case the hook will be called when any matching node is updated.
	 * <p>
	 * As always, when hooks are registered, they are immediately triggered
	 * for all existing nodes that match their scope,
	 * allowing the hooks to "get caught up" with all changes that occurred before they were registered.
	 * <p>
	 * Hook methods can accept arguments which will be injected by the framework when the hook is called.
	 * <p>
	 * An argument of type {@link Reference} will receive a reference to the specific object that changed and triggered the hook.
	 * This is useful if the scope is parameterized, since the reference passed to the method will have all its parameters bound.
	 * The target type of a {@link Reference} argument must match that of the hook's scope.
	 * <p>
	 * An argument of type {@link BindingEnvironment} will receive bindings for all parameters in the hook's scope path.
	 * This is useful if the hook implementation wants to access related references.
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * Example:
	 * <pre>{@code
	 * class ExampleHooks {
	 *     @Hook("/widgets/-widget-")
	 *     void onWidgetChanged(Reference<Widget> widgetRef) {
	 *         // Simple hook that just accesses the object that changed
	 *         Widget widget = widgetRef.value();
	 *         ...
	 *     }
	 *
	 *     interface Refs {
	 *         // An example of a related reference, using the same parameter name as the hook scope
	 *         @ReferencePath("/widgetConfigs/-widget-")
	 *         Reference<WidgetConfig> widgetConfig();
	 *     }
	 *
	 *     @Hook("/widgets/-widget-")
	 *     void onWidgetChanged(BindingEnvironment bindings) {
	 *         // Access a related object using the same parameter bindings
	 *         WidgetConfig config = refs.widgetConfig().boundBy(bindings).value();
	 *         ...
	 *     }
	 * }
	 * }</pre>
	 *
	 * Hook methods must not be static or private, but they can be package-private.
	 * Inherited methods are included in the scan.
	 * If a subclass overrides a hook method, only the most-derived override is registered.
	 * <p>
	 * The Hook class must have no methods inaccessible to the given {@code lookup}.
	 * Such methods interfere with our ability to validate that the hook methods are well-formed.
	 *
	 * @param receiver the object whose {@link Hook @Hook}-annotated methods should be registered
